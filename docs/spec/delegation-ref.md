## What is delegation-ref

`delegation_ref` is a SHA-256 hex pointer to a delegation artifact — a structured document that records the authorization chain: who authorized whom, to do what, within what scope, under which policy version, and until when.

**What it enables:** a Mycelium verifier can establish that a delegated action was explicitly authorized before it was admitted. Without `delegation_ref`, a trail record proves only that an agent performed an action — not that it was permitted to do so. With `delegation_ref`, the record carries a tamper-evident pointer to the authorization that preceded it.

**What it does not do:** `delegation_ref` does not prove the delegation artifact is still valid at verification time. For post-authorization invalidation, see [`revocation-ref.md`](./revocation-ref.md). For the timestamps that bound the authority check window, see `authority_verified_at_ms` in [`action-ref.md`](./action-ref.md).

## Derivation

`delegation_ref` is `SHA-256(JCS(delegation_artifact))` where:

- **JCS** is RFC 8785 canonical JSON: `json.dumps(obj, separators=(',',':'), sort_keys=True, ensure_ascii=False)`
- **SHA-256** lowercase hex
- `delegation_artifact` must contain at minimum: `delegator`, `delegatee`, `capability`, `scope`, `expires_at`, `policy_version`, `version`

```python
import hashlib, json

def jcs(obj):
    return json.dumps(obj, separators=(',', ':'), sort_keys=True, ensure_ascii=False)

delegation_artifact = {
    "capability":     "payment.send",
    "delegatee":      "pioneer-agent-001",
    "delegator":      "giskard-self",
    "expires_at":     "2026-05-27T00:00:00.000Z",
    "policy_version": "2026-05-01",
    "scope":          "mycelium:payment",
    "version":        "delegation-ref-v1",
}
delegation_ref = hashlib.sha256(jcs(delegation_artifact).encode()).hexdigest()
# 69e672d1ba7484e3620d4d4ed9b366c4d4c8b203c4176f60f000e2b793761ffb
```

## Invariants

**1. envelope-only — does not enter action_ref preimage**

`delegation_ref` is carried in the trail envelope. It never enters the four-field preimage (`action_type`, `agent_id`, `scope`, `timestamp`). Changing or removing `delegation_ref` does not change `action_ref`.

**2. artifact commits to the full authorization chain**

The delegation artifact should include both `delegator` (the human or agent that granted) and `delegatee` (the agent that received). Multi-hop chains (human → orchestrator → leaf agent) should be represented as separate linked delegation artifacts, each with its own `delegation_ref`.

**3. scope must match**

A conformant implementation SHOULD verify that the `scope` in the delegation artifact matches the `scope` in the action preimage. A mismatch means the delegation was for a different authorization boundary than the action claimed.

**4. expires_at is informational**

The `expires_at` field is part of the artifact and enters the hash. It does not expire the `delegation_ref` itself — it is the integrator's responsibility to check currency. A `delegation_ref` pointing to an expired artifact is not invalid; it is a pointer to an artifact that is no longer in force.

**5. opaque artifact format beyond required fields**

The delegation artifact schema is implementer-defined beyond the required fields. Additional fields (e.g. `conditions`, `max_amount`, `audit_trail_id`) are permitted and enter the hash.

## Relationship to other refs

| Ref | What it answers |
|-----|----------------|
| `delegation_ref` | Who authorized this action, under what policy? |
| `revocation_ref` | Has a prior authorization been invalidated? |
| `idempotency_ref` | Is this a duplicate of a prior submission? |
| `negotiation_ref` | Was there a prior agreement (capability-grant, covenant)? |
