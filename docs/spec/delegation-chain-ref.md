## What is delegation-chain-ref

`delegation_chain_ref` is a SHA-256 hex pointer to a chain artifact — a structured document that records a multi-hop delegation sequence and the final action executed by the leaf agent. It answers the question a single `delegation_ref` cannot: in a system where agent A authorized B who authorized C who authorized D, is the complete chain verifiable end-to-end without trusting any intermediary?

**What it enables:** a Mycelium verifier holding `delegation_chain_ref` can reconstruct the full authorization path from root delegator to leaf action, verify each hop's `delegation_ref` independently, confirm chain continuity (each `delegatee` equals the next `delegator`), and confirm the leaf agent's final action_ref. No single intermediary needs to be trusted — each hop is a tamper-evident commitment to the delegation artifact that authorized it.

**What it does not do:** `delegation_chain_ref` does not validate that individual delegation artifacts are still in force (see [`revocation-ref.md`](./revocation-ref.md) for invalidation). It does not constrain scope narrowing between hops — that is the implementer's policy. It does not replace the individual `delegation_ref` fields carried in each hop's trail record.

## Derivation

`delegation_chain_ref` is `SHA-256(JCS(chain_artifact))` where:

- **JCS** is RFC 8785 canonical JSON: `json.dumps(obj, separators=(',',':'), sort_keys=True, ensure_ascii=False)`
- **SHA-256** lowercase hex
- `chain_artifact` must contain at minimum: `chain_id`, `hops`, `leaf_action_ref`, `root_delegator`, `scope`, `version`
- Each element of `hops` must contain: `delegatee`, `delegator`, `delegation_ref`, `scope`

```python
import hashlib, json

def jcs(obj):
    return json.dumps(obj, separators=(',', ':'), sort_keys=True, ensure_ascii=False)

chain_artifact = {
    "chain_id":       "chain_b1f4a2d7c9e3",
    "hops": [

    ],

## Fields

### chain_artifact

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `chain_id` | string | Client-generated unique identifier for this chain instance. |
| `hops` | array | Ordered list of delegation hops, root→leaf. See hop fields below. |
| `leaf_action_ref` | SHA-256 hex | `action_ref` of the final action executed by `hops[-1].delegatee`. Derived per [`action-ref.md`](./action-ref.md). |
| `root_delegator` | string | The origin of the chain. Must equal `hops[0].delegator`. |
| `scope` | string | Top-level scope for the chain. Must match `hops[0].scope`. |
| `version` | string | Always `"delegation-chain-ref-v1"` for this spec version. |

### hop object

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `delegatee` | string | Agent that received this delegation. Must equal `hops[i+1].delegator` for all non-leaf hops. |
| `delegator` | string | Agent that granted this delegation. Must equal `hops[i-1].delegatee` for all non-root hops. |
| `delegation_ref` | SHA-256 hex | Hash of the delegation artifact for this hop, derived per [`delegation-ref.md`](./delegation-ref.md). |
| `scope` | string | Scope of this hop. Implementers SHOULD verify it is equal to or a subset of the parent hop's scope. |

## Chain linkage via parent_delegation_ref

Individual delegation artifacts in a chain SHOULD include a `parent_delegation_ref` field pointing to the preceding hop's `delegation_ref`. This is not required by the chain_artifact schema — the chain artifact itself encodes ordering via the `hops` array — but `parent_delegation_ref` in each artifact creates an independent linked-list structure that a verifier can traverse without the chain artifact:

```
hop1_artifact.delegation_ref  ←──────────────────────────────  (root, no parent)
hop2_artifact.parent_delegation_ref = hop1_artifact.delegation_ref
hop3_artifact.parent_delegation_ref = hop2_artifact.delegation_ref
```

A verifier with only `leaf_action_ref` and the hop3 delegation artifact can walk backward to the root by following `parent_delegation_ref` at each step. `delegation_chain_ref` provides forward traversal (root→leaf) in a single hash; `parent_delegation_ref` provides backward traversal (leaf→root) without the chain artifact.

---

## Invariants

**1. chain continuity**

For all `i` from 0 to `len(hops)-2`: `hops[i].delegatee == hops[i+1].delegator`. A verifier who finds a break in this chain MUST reject it as non-conformant.

**2. root anchoring**

`root_delegator == hops[0].delegator`. The chain artifact commits to who started the chain.

**3. leaf anchoring**

`leaf_action_ref` is the `action_ref` derived from the leaf agent's action preimage. It connects the authorization chain to the specific action that was taken. A verifier can independently derive `leaf_action_ref` from the four preimage fields and compare.

**4. envelope-only — does not enter action_ref preimage**

`delegation_chain_ref` is carried in the trail envelope. It never enters the four-field preimage (`action_type`, `agent_id`, `scope`, `timestamp`).

**5. hops are append-only**

`delegation_chain_ref` commits to a specific chain snapshot. If the chain is extended by another hop, a new chain artifact is created with a new `chain_id`. The original chain artifact is not mutated.

**6. minimum chain length is two hops**

A single delegation is expressed as `delegation_ref` per [`delegation-ref.md`](./delegation-ref.md). `delegation_chain_ref` is for chains of two or more hops.

## Position in the envelope

`delegation_chain_ref` is carried at the envelope level of the leaf agent's trail record — the record that commits the final action:

```json
{
  "packet_version":        "1.0",
  "action_ref":            "<leaf_action_ref>",
  "delegation_ref":        "<hop N delegation_ref — the leaf's direct delegation>",
  "delegation_chain_ref":  "<sha256 hex — derived from chain_artifact>",
  "hash_algo":             "sha256",
  "preimage_format":       "jcs-rfc8785-v1",
  "preimage": {
    "action_type": "payment.route",
    "agent_id":    "soma-agent",
    "scope":       "mycelium:payment",
    "timestamp":   "2026-05-26T20:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

The leaf record carries both its direct `delegation_ref` (the authorization from its immediate parent) and `delegation_chain_ref` (the full chain from root to leaf). Intermediate hop records carry only their own `delegation_ref`.

## Relationship to composition-ref

| Ref | What it answers |
|-----|----------------|
| `delegation_ref` | Who authorized this single hop, under what policy? |
| `delegation_chain_ref` | Is the full authorization chain from root to leaf valid? |
| `composition_ref` | Did delegation + revocation + dual-timestamps compose correctly for one action? |

`delegation_chain_ref` and `composition_ref` are complementary. A leaf action in a multi-hop chain may carry both: `delegation_chain_ref` for chain integrity and `composition_ref` for lifecycle completeness at the leaf hop.
