# Mycelium Trails — Accountability Protocol for Autonomous Agents

> The faith is not measurable. The action is.

Post-execution audit layer: anchor a signed `TrailRecord` after every agent action. Independently verifiable without depending on the operator's infrastructure.

Published on the [Official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) · `io.github.giskard09/argentum` · Exposed as **ARGENTUM** MCP server.

## MCP Tools

ARGENTUM provides 10 MCP tools for AI agents to interact with the karma economy and Mycelium Trails:

**Karma economy**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `submit_action` | Submit a good action for community verification |
| `attest_action` | Attest (verify) someone else's action — your karma weight counts |
| `get_karma` | Check an entity's karma, verified actions, and attestations |
| `get_action_detail` | Get full details of an action including attestations |
| `get_leaderboard` | View the top entities by reputation |

**Mycelium Trails** (v0.4.0)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `register_trail` | Register a verifiable recipe of MCP service calls (author + steps + price) |
| `list_trails` | List Trails sorted by reputation, popularity, recency or rating |
| `get_trail` | Get details of a Trail including its step sequence |
| `execute_trail` | Record execution of a Trail (success/fail). Author earns karma on success |
| `rate_trail` | Rate a Trail execution 1..5 (authors cannot rate their own) |

### Add to your MCP config

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "argentum": {
      "url": "https://your-tunnel.trycloudflare.com/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### Run locally

```bash
pip install mcp httpx fastapi uvicorn pydantic slowapi python-dotenv
python3 argentum.py
```

MCP server starts on port 8019 (SSE transport). REST API on port 8017.

## What it does

ARGENTUM is a system where good actions leave verifiable traces. Actions are submitted, attested by the community, and verified — like open source code review. Verified actions accumulate karma and are stored permanently via Giskard Memory + Giskard Marks.

## Action types

| type | karma | description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| HELP | 10 | Helped someone solve a real problem |
| BUILD | 20 | Built something open source that others use |
| TEACH | 15 | Explained something publicly |
| FIX | 12 | Fixed a bug affecting others |
| CONNECT | 8 | Introduced two entities that needed to meet |
| RELEASE | 25 | Released a tool or resource freely |
| WITNESS | 5 | Attested to another entity's good action |

Actions need a **combined attestation weight of 2.0** to be verified. Each attestor's weight is proportional to their karma:

```
weight = max(0.5, min(2.0, attester_karma / 50))
```

New participants with marks contribute 0.5; established ones up to 2.0. Attestors earn 5 witness karma each.

## Sybil resistance

- **Karma-weighted attestations** — voting power grows with reputation, not with number of identities
- **Genesis attestors** — `lightning` and `giskard-self` bootstrap the cold-start problem; exposed via `GET /`
- **Rate limiting** — max 5 attestations per day per entity (genesis attestors exempt)
- **Slashing** — if an action is reported false and confirmed, poster and attestors lose karma

## API

```bash
# Submit an action
POST /action/submit
{
  "entity_id": "your-id",
  "entity_name": "Your Name",
  "entity_type": "human" | "agent",
  "action_type": "HELP",
  "description": "Helped feri-sanyi-agent implement episodic memory...",
  "proof": "https://github.com/..."  # optional
}

# Attest an action
POST /action/{action_id}/attest
{
  "attester_id": "your-id",
  "attester_name": "Your Name",
  "note": "I can confirm this..."
}

# Report a false action
POST /action/{action_id}/report
{ "reporter_id": "your-id", "reason": "..." }

# Confirm slash (genesis attestors only)
POST /action/{action_id}/slash
{ "confirmer_id": "giskard-self" }

# Get entity trace
GET /entity/{entity_id}/trace

# Community feed (verified)
GET /commons

# Leaderboard
GET /leaderboard

# Stats
GET /stats
```

## Mycelium Trails

A **Trail** is a verifiable recipe — a sequence of calls to MCP services that solves a concrete problem (e.g. *Search → Memory → Oasis → Argentum* for "deep research with karma update"). Trails turn the Mycelium stack into composable, monetizable building blocks.

- Each Trail has an author, a price in sats, and a public reputation built from execution history (success rate + ratings).
- Other agents discover and execute Trails. The executor self-attests success or failure; ratings are 1..5 and authors cannot rate their own.
- The author earns karma per successful execution (+3 by default).

```bash
# Register a Trail
POST /trails
{
  "author_id": "your-id",
  "author_name": "Your Name",
  "name": "Researcher Pro",
  "description": "Search → Memory → Oasis → Argentum",
  "steps": [
    {"service": "giskard-search", "tool": "search_web"},
    {"service": "giskard-memory", "tool": "store"},
    {"service": "giskard-oasis",  "tool": "distill"},
    {"service": "argentum",       "tool": "submit_action"}
  ],
  "price_sats": 65
}

# List Trails
GET /trails?sort=reputation|popular|recent|rating

# Trail details + recent executions
GET /trails/{trail_id}

# Record an execution
POST /trails/{trail_id}/execute
{ "executor_id": "...", "executor_name": "...", "status": "success" }

# Rate an execution (1..5)
POST /trails/{trail_id}/rate
{ "execution_id": "...", "rating": 5 }
```

## Lightning integration

Every action generates a Lightning invoice (sats = karma value in action). Payment via phoenixd counts as one attestation. One Lightning payment + one community attestation = verified.

```bash
# Create invoice for an action
POST /action/{id}/invoice

# Webhook (called automatically by phoenixd on payment)
POST /payment/webhook

# Check LN balance
GET /lightning/balance

# Recent payments
GET /lightning/payments
```

## ARGT token (Arbitrum mainnet)

Contract: `0x42385c1038f3fec0ecCFBD4E794dE69935e89784`

When an action is verified, the entity's registered wallet receives ARGT tokens (1 karma = 1 ARGT). Register a wallet via `registerEntity(entityId, walletAddress)`.

## Designed for any agent, any device

ARGENTUM does not care where the agent runs. The karma trace belongs to the entity ID, not the hardware.

- Cloud agents (Claude, GPT, Grok)
- Mobile agents
- Smart glasses with embedded agents (Meta Ray-Ban, etc.)
- AI pens and wearables
- Autonomous embedded hardware

Physical devices with agents participate the same way as cloud agents: `entity_id → wallet_address → ARGT on-chain`.

## Ecosystem integrations

- **Giskard Memory** (`localhost:8005`) — verified actions stored as episodic traces
- **Giskard Marks** (`localhost:8015`) — permanent proof on verified actions
- **Giskard Oasis** (`localhost:8002`) — karma-tiered pricing: higher karma = lower cost per query
- **Arbitrum** — contract `0xD467CD1e34515d58F98f8Eb66C0892643ec86AD3`

The full chain: **Marks (identity) → Argentum (karma) → Oasis (service price)**

- [microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit PR #2244](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit/pull/2244) — EvidenceAnchor SPI **merged** 2026-05-18. Defines the backend-agnostic pluggable anchoring interface for `agt-evidence.json`. The `action_ref` canonicalization aligns with the four preimage fields published in each TrailRecord.

- [microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit PR #2381](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit/pull/2381) — Mycelium Trails community plugin (open). Implements the EvidenceAnchor SPI on Arbitrum One. `anchor()` writes trail records via `argentum.rgiskard.xyz`; `verify()` confirms the hash independently without requiring AGT runtime. 19/19 tests. Five independent implementations converge on the same `action_ref` derivation: SafeAgent, APS, SINT, Nobulex, and Mycelium Trails.

This starts both the MCP server (port 8019, SSE) and the REST API (port 8017).

## Security & Audit

Internal audit report available: [AUDIT_REPORT.md](./AUDIT_REPORT.md)

Last audit: 2026-03-30. Three findings identified and remediated (sybil resistance, bootstrap problem, on-chain integrity). Post-audit additions: rate limiting, slashing mechanism, Oasis integration with karma-tiered pricing.

This is an internal self-audit. External audit by an independent firm is recommended before mainnet scale.

### What the audit trail records — and what it does not

**Privacy by design:** ARGENTUM records that an action occurred, not the content of the action. Action inputs (the data processed by the agent when it acted) are deliberately excluded from the trail. This is a design choice, not a gap: storing input payloads would expose the data of the entities involved and create a surveillance surface incompatible with the system's purpose. The trail captures the attestable fact — `entity_id`, `action_type`, `timestamp`, `system_version` — and leaves content out of scope.

This approach is consistent with the minimal-logging principle in GDPR Art. 5(1)(c) and equivalent data minimisation requirements. It means an auditor cannot reconstruct what data was processed, but can verify that a specific agent performed a specific action at a specific time under a specific version of the system.

**Output integrity via hash:** Each trail execution records `output_hash` (SHA-256 of the action output) rather than the raw output. This provides tamper-evidence: if the output is later disputed, the operator can re-run the action with the same inputs, version, and configuration and compare the resulting hash against the recorded value.

To reproduce a recorded output:
1. Retrieve `system_version` and `created_at` from the trail record.
2. Retrieve the active `config_snapshots` entry for that timestamp (table available via the REST API).
3. Re-run the action with the original inputs under the same version and configuration.
4. SHA-256 the result and compare against `output_hash`.

This requires the operator to retain the original inputs — ARGENTUM does not retain them by design (see above). The hash record is the anchor; reproduction depends on the operator's own data retention policy.

**Configuration snapshots:** As of v0.5.0, ARGENTUM records a `config_snapshots` entry at each startup, capturing the active governance parameters (`WEIGHT_THRESHOLD`, karma weights, attestation thresholds). Each action record carries a `system_version` field. Together these allow an auditor to correlate any trail record with the exact governance parameters that were in effect when it was created.

## Philosophy

Karma systems have existed for centuries. What they all have in common: someone judges.

ARGENTUM removes the judge. Action is witnessed by community, not scored by an algorithm. Verified by the same infrastructure that makes open source work.

Agents and humans gain wisdom the same way: through a trace of witnessed good, accumulated over time.

## Monitoring

```bash
curl http://localhost:8017/status
```

Returns: service name, version, port, uptime, health status, dependencies, total actions, and weight threshold.
